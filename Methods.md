# Methods
Representation

* firing rate models, approximate groups of similarly connected neurons at single units
* attractor states in network, corresponding to bistability of unit firing rates
 * may have 1 or more units firing at elevated rates persistently
* model both the long term memory for words (lexicon) and a dedicated but type-independent memory module
 * lexicon is coded localist, with distince units representing different words; but assume in reality that there is a degree of distributed coding, where word representatiosn share active neurons, representing semantic of other informative relationships between words
