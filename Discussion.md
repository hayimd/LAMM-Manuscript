Strengths

* Can encode and recall a list on single presentation
* Exhibits correct scaling relationship of recall to list length
* Is a simple, biological model with very little experimenter manipulation (plasticity is always on, recall is automoatic beyond some basic external current changes)

Weaknesses

* Does not fit the data; difficult to get it to
* Lack of WTA dynamic in memory layer means that memory activity is largely predetermined by item inputs (?)
* Seems to have neither a primacy nor recency mechanism

Comparisons to other models

* Recall is driven by associative linking \cite{Raaijmakers1981,Howard2002,Davelaar2005,Romani2013}.
* Simple model, nothing very sophisticated nor fancy \cite[c.f. ]{Farrell2012,Verduzco-Flores2012,Lehman2013}

Directions
* A true kWTA in the emory layer / more independent dynamics \cite[more like ]{Davelaar2005,Litwin-Kumar2012}
* Some kind of primacy mechanism (attention to list-start context?)
* multiple lists -- to see if the concept of using ASTP is indeed viable.
