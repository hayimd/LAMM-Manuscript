# Results

That the model recalls as broadly intended

* can recall sequences imperfectly
 * compare with behavioural data
* recall depends on list orderings
* recall worsens with noise; worsens with recall phase plasticity
* recall vs list length scales as power law \cite{Murdock1962}


Analaysis of dynamics

* correlations showing memory activity driven mainly by projective connectivity
* recall of words vs initial biases, c.f receptive fields -- seemingly a broad null result
 * BUT at least show \(\Delta W\) vs intial $W$ 
* sequences dont always follow strongest links, c.f. \cite{Romani2013} transition model
* comparison of recall plasticity vs none sequences


Analysis of robustness <-- not done

* what effect to parameter changes have?
 * how much heterogeneity is there built in?
 * how does this compare to large paramter changes?
