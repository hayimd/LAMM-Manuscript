# Results

That the model recalls as broadly intended

* can recall sequences imperfectly
.* compare with behavioural data
* correlations showing memory activity driven mainly by projective connectivity
* recall worsens with noise; worsens with recall phase plasticity
* recall vs list length scales as power law \cite{Murdock1962}


Analaysis of dynamics

* sequences dont always follow strongest links, c.f. \cite{Romani2013} transition model
* comparison of recall plasticity vs none sequences
* recall of words vs initial biases, c.f receptive fields -- seemingly a broad null result
