## That the model recalls as broadly intended

* can recall sequences imperfectly (Figure \ref{sequence})
 * compare with behavioural data
* recall depends on list orderings (Fig. \ref{projectivity})
* recall worsens with noise; worsens with recall phase plasticity (Fig. \ref{noise})
* recall vs list length scales as power law \cite{Murdock1962} (Fig. \ref{scaling})
