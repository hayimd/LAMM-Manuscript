# Results

## That the model recalls as broadly intended

* can recall sequences imperfectly (Figure \ref{sequence})
 * compare with behavioural data
* recall depends on list length (Fig \ref{listlength})
* recall depends on list orderings (Fig. \ref{projectivity})
* recall worsens with noise; worsens with recall phase plasticity (Fig. \ref{noise})
