# Introduction
## Word list recall

## Memory theories, summary of trends
Buffers (active maintenance) vs similarity (interference)
Dual store vs single store
- \cite{Davelaar2005} and \cite{Rabbitt1968} -> \cite{Miller2010} necessity of buffers (dual mechanisms)

## Summary of modeling approaches
Process models, recall probability laws, biological mechanistic models
* Processes as algorithmic, simulated time dependent
* Recall laws as defining a probability for recalls given parameters
* Specific mechanistic/ biological implementations, \cite{Lisman1995,Grossberg1978}
