# Introduction
The existence and nature of a distinction between short and long term memory has been debated for over a century \cite{James1890,Jonides2008}. Associative buffer models, such as Raaijmakers and Shiffrin’s Search of Associative Memory \cite[SAM, ]{Raaijmakers1981}, present computational implementations of the highly influential theory of separate but interacting short and long-term memory processes \cite{Atkinson1968,Baddeley1974}.

The features of SAM illustrate the canonical dual-storage algorithm: Items to be recalled are entered into a temporary storage buffer, replacing prior items if the buffer is full, and therein form episodic associations with other buffer items, and perhaps also a context marker. Those associations then serve as cues for consecutive recalls, producing many of the familiar dynamics of list recall performance \cite{Davelaar2005}. 

The Linking via Active Maintenance Model aims to explore the biological feasibility of associative buffer memory theories by implementing them as neuronal networks. Additionally, advance the debate between dual- and single-memory models \cite{Brown2002,Howard2002,Cowan2008} by arguing that, when implemented neuronally, associative buffer networks incorporate temporal context dynamics \cite{Usher2008}. Finally, LAMM’s architecture is based upon prior work showing that buffer mediated associations are necessary to explain the effects of degraded stimuli on recall \cite{Piquado2010,Miller2010,Cousins2014}.

## Word list recall

- Is an experimental paradigm with long history as a model system for short term memory and rich behavioural phenomena.

Recall for sequentially presented lists of items has long been a key experimental paradigm for revealing hidden structure in memory dynamics. Dependencies on list-position, presentation timing, temporal contiguity, effects of rehearsal, intra- and inter-list interference, categorical and acoustic relatedness, and scaling laws have all been observed \cite{Murdock1962,Rundus1971,Kahana1996,Golomb2008,Grenfell-Essam2012,Cowan2008a,Farrell2011a} (more!). Disruptions and distractions have been used to probe the stages and modalities of memory encoding \cite{Carroll2012Elliot1998,Spataro2013,Cowan2008} including the finding of a retroactive effect indicating that encoding into short term memory continues beyond the removal of the stimulus \cite{Rabbitt1981,Cousins2014}.

- several models proposed, notably differnetial memory for late list items key support for the idea of the short term memory buffer.

## Memory theories, summary of trends
Buffers (active maintenance) vs similarity (interference)
Dual store vs single store

- Whether there are dedicated memory modules or whether short term memory is effected by attentional processes \cite{Postle2006,Jonides2008,Courtney2004}
- \cite{Davelaar2005} and \cite{Rabbitt1968} -> \cite{Miller2010} necessity of buffers (dual mechanisms)
