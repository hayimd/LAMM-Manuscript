## Analaysis of dynamics

* correlations showing memory activity driven mainly by projective connectivity
* recall of words vs initial biases, c.f receptive fields -- seemingly a broad null result
  - BUT at least show \(\Delta W\) vs intial \(W\) 
* recall vs list length scales as power law \cite{Murdock1962} (Fig. \ref{scaling})
sequences dont always follow strongest links, c.f. \cite{Romani2013} transition model
  - comparison of recall plasticity vs none sequences
* recall increases with rehearsal for early items \cite{Rundus1971,Lansner2013} (Fig. S\ref{rehearsal})

### Variability in memory network representations

LAMM is partly motivated by the question of how the computational idea of a buffer might be implemented biologically. Since the aim is not to re-represent all of LTM in an vast array of primary buffers -- the combinatorial explosion warned of by Baddeley's critics \cite{Postle2006} -- the challenge becomes how to temporarily identify a limited number of memory activity states with certain stimuli. LAMM's answer to this is to reinforce already heterogeneous biases in connectivity via synaptic potentiation, in a one-shot, online learning process. Associative short term potentiation, recently identified by \citet{Erickson2010} (ASTP), provides an ideal candidate plasticity, with a fast onset and medium-term decay. Given the dependence on both pre- and post-synaptic firing rates and post-synaptic bursting, \citet{Miller2010} propose a 'quadruplet' rule of two pre- and two post-synaptic spikes in their spike-timing dependent model for ASTP. For our rate model units, we take the most general interpretation in which synaptic increases depend on a threshholded product of the pre- and post-synaptic rates (Eq. \ref{potent}).

We should like to know, therefore, how much the initial heterogeneity contributes to the dynamics in LAMM, and how much varies trial to trial. Variability may allow more flexible encoding, especially for disambiguating repeated items in complex, lists where it is desirable that the same item can be bound to  different memory activities in different contexts. On the other hand, heterogeneity in the item-memory connections is needed to ensure that new items are able to evoke different memory activities and not just reinforce those active. Fig. \ref{memcorrs}a shows correlations in the memory activity representing activations of different items in different lists. For a given initialisation of network connectivity, the memory activity representing a given item is highly consistent over different lists, indicating that memory activity is largely driven by the initial item-memory connectivity, and only slightly affected by prior history. Learning during list presentation cannot thus arbitrarily identify any memory network activity pattern to any item, but instead acts to refine the initial heterogeneity, somewhat analogously to the development of receptive fields (Supplementary fig. XX). By contrast, memory activity exhibits no knowledge of list position, showing no correlation between memory activity for the same item positions in different lists (\ref{memcorrs}b). \ref{memcorrs}c confirms the dependence on initial connectivity, showing strong correlation in memory representations of a single item between lists, but not between network initialisations.

Correlations in memory activity for different items within a list (off-diagonal elements in \ref{memcorrs}a) were not found to predict overall memory performance. In fact, many average measures (including XXXX) were found to have no effect on list performance. On the other hand, heterogeneity in item-memory connectivity appeared to result in some words being more easily recalled than others, despite all items sending and receiving the same total synaptic efficacy to and from the memory layer. Fig. \ref{projectivity} shows the recall probability for each word in a 7 word list, averaged over all 5040 different permutations of that list. Recall for individual items varies greatly, from around 40-90%, with a mean of 62%. Moreover, recall for individual words also depended on their presentation position, with highest recall when presented latest in the list, and lowest when presented early (\ref{projectivity}b). The stereotypical serial effect curves in \ref{projectivity}b for all items suggests that the network does favour later positions over earlier (and note that experimental paradigms do not test memory for all permutations of a single list). However, it is also clear that different items are differently recallable which, since each item receives and sends the same net connectivity, must be due to interactions between items, specifically their connectivities with the memory layer. In \cite{Cousins2014} and prior experiments, words tested are chosen to have similar levels of salience and overall mutual semantic relatedness -- in the network initialised in Fig. \ref{projectivity}, this cannot be the case.

### Reactivation and rehearsal 

\citet{Rundus1971} found that for subjects using overt rehearsal as a mnemonic strategy, recall increased with the frequency of rehearsal for a given item, but that early items were rehearsed more and recalled less than later ones. \citet{Lansner2013} propose a single layer free recall model similar to our item layer, and which relies heavily on reactivations of already presented items during the remainder of the list. In their model, early items are also reactivated more often, and recall for these early items largely disappears if such reactivation is suppressed. Supplementary fig. \ref{rehearsal} shows spontaneous reactivations of item in LAMM, with greater frequency for earlier items, and increased recall in lists where that item reactivates. Unlike \cite{Lansner2013}, recall for these early items does not require reactivation, but can be cued via the memory network.
