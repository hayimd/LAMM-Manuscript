## Analaysis of dynamics

* correlations showing memory activity driven mainly by projective connectivity

* recall of words vs initial biases, c.f receptive fields -- seemingly a broad null result
   * BUT at least show \(\Delta W\) vs intial \(W\) 

* recall vs list length scales as power law \cite{Murdock1962} (Fig. \ref{scaling})
sequences dont always follow strongest links, c.f. \cite{Romani2013} transition model
    - comparison of recall plasticity vs none sequences


* recall increases with rehearsal for early items \cite{Rundus1971,Lansner2013} (Fig. S\ref{rehearsal})* 

## Analysis of robustness <-- not done

* what effect to parameter changes have?
 * how much heterogeneity is there built in?
 * how does this compare to large paramter changes?
